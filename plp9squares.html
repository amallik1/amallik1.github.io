    <p>For this project, I learned how to use repetitive figures to create something interesting. The points only vary in size, but still have a clear pattern of growing from small to large and then back to small again. By adding randomness to the addition of each point and bleeding one point from the bottom of one page to the top of the next, I was able to create interest while maintaining directional flow throughout the work.
    Using lines for this project allowed me to work with asymmetry while maintaining balance. The lines on the left have less weight and are more spread out while the lines on the right have a heavier weight and are closer together to balance everything out. The order in which each line is added is also unpredictable which makes it more interesting.</p>
