    <p>Creating the layout of this cube challenged my spatial awareness abilities. The concept of creating a two-dimensional image that will be presented as a three-dimensional object was difficult and forced me to consider how little changes I make to one object could drastically affect the layout of the opposite end.
    When presented in a three-dimensional layout, I had to be extremely aware of how multiples of the same object could interact with each other. For that reason, I was very strategic with where I placed circles that would bleed so that it could connect with circles on other cubes and create something interesting without being too symmetrical.</p>
