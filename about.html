    <p>Hi, I'm Angie! I am a student in the 3+ Master of Visual Communication Design Program at Arizona State University. This portfolio documents my first semester of projects in the program as well as the coding knowledge that I have acquired over the last 10 weeks. In my free time, I like to paint, hike, and watch TV. I hope to pursue a career at an advertising or marketing firm after completing my degree and possibly obtain an MBA. Feel free to contact me with any questions!</p>
