    <p>When creating the different Hâ€™s, I became very aware of the different aspects of the letterform. I began to notice subtle variations in the location of the crossbar as well as the relationship between the crossbar and vertical strokes. After a lot of trial, I was able to create a regular, thin, and bold version of my H that feel as though they all belong within the same typeface.
    For this first composition, I struggled a lot with finding a balance between symmetry and asymmetry. Due to the unique shape and angle, creating a perfectly symmetrical piece seemed like the best way to add balance and stability. However, that also resulted in an uninteresting project. To remedy that issue, I flipped some of the tiles to create something slightly asymmetrical while maintaining enough symmetry to make it balanced.
    For this second composition, I was able to focus more on the negative space due to the size of each letterform within the tile. The size forced me to view the letterform as merely lines and borders that I could piece together for my final composition. The composition looks symmetrical horizontally, but asymmetry can be found in the negative spaces vertically. The final composition creates a sort of tiling or textile work that completely transformed the original H.</p>
